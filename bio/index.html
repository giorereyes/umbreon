                <div class="bio">
                    <p> Hi, I’m Gio. Nice to meet you!</p>
                    I have over 8 years experience 
                    in the digital ad space. I have worked with publishers to update 
                    ad offerings and lead ad product projects on site redesigns.<br><br>

                    Online ads have gotten a bad rep, and I’m working to fix that. I’ve 
                    made it my mission to ensure that online ads are effectively meeting 
                    client demands while respecting the user’s experience.<br><br>

                    I am a self-proclaimed nerd, a dog-father to a terrier-akita 
                    mix named Atticus and a front-end web dev novice. When I am not 
                    thinking about ads I am usually learning to code, running or dreaming 
                    of playing D&D.

                                When it comes to everything you want in a co-worker, 
                                Gio ticks all the boxes: organized, humble, sharp, 
                                and a damn good-natured soul! <br><br>
                                When the Product/Engineering team re-platformed our 
                                entire web app in 2017, I had the luxury of having 
                                him by my side to translate ad-speak into something 
                                a Product Manager who had never touched ad tech could 
                                understand. In a world that is plagued with mountains 
                                of ambiguous information, he kept things tidy and helped 
                                myself and the engineers ship a stellar end-product. <br><br>
                                And let me tell you, this guy knows DFP like the back of 
                                his hand, has a deep understanding of things that I don't 
                                (VAST, VPAID, IMA), and has the technical chops to dive right 
                                into dev tools with the engineers in order to debug all the 
                                quirky brain teasers that come with running ads in a single-page 
                                application. <br><br>
                                In fewer words, he crushes it—day in and day out. <br><br>

                                If you're looking for someone who can bring order to chaos, 
                                Gio is your guy!

                                Hardworking is the word that comes to mind when I think of 
                                Giovanni. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Giovanni for almost 4 
                                years, during which he reported to me. Above all, I was 
                                impressed with Giovanni’s ability to take on a task and make it 
                                happen. And of course, his determination and loyalty. Giovanni 
                                was always positive and willing to take on any project that was 
                                assigned to him and volunteered for projects that were not. <br><br>
                                Giovanni would be a true asset for any positions requiring him to 
                                drive planning and execution of a program as well as finding 
                                solutions to overcome obstacles. Giovanni gets the job done.

                                    I hired Gio this year as business manager at Hilltop Views, the St. 
                                    Edward's University campus newspaper. He has turned the day-
                                    to-day working of the paper around by organizing the office, both 
                                    physically and in terms of creating systems that help us work 
                                    better. Without my urging, he has done everything from clean up 
                                    the cluttered newsroom to organize the chaotic archives. Most 
                                    importantly, he excels at his most critical task, advertising billing 
                                    and collections. Without Gio's low-key demeanor and hyper-
                                    organized work skills we would still be catching up when it comes 
                                    to our books. He is a gem, easy to work with, take-charge and 
                                    efficient. I highly recommend Gio, but please wait to hire him until 
                                    he graduates. Hilltop Views needs him!
