                        <h3> Bradley Dubs </h3>
                        <p class="jobTitle"> Product at FloSports </p>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to everything you want in a co-worker, 
                            Gio ticks all the boxes: organized, humble, sharp, 
                            and a damn good-natured soul! <br><br>
                            When the Product/Engineering team re-platformed our 
                            entire web app in 2017, I had the luxury of having 
                            him by my side to translate ad-speak into something 
                            a Product Manager who had never touched ad tech could 
                            understand. In a world that is plagued with mountains 
                            of ambiguous information, he kept things tidy and helped 
                            myself and the engineers ship a stellar end-product. <br><br>
                            And let me tell you, this guy knows DFP like the back of 
                            his hand, has a deep understanding of things that I don't 
                            (VAST, VPAID, IMA), and has the technical chops to dive right 
                            into dev tools with the engineers in order to debug all the 
                            quirky brain teasers that come with running ads in a single-page 
                            application. <br><br>
                            In fewer words, he crushes it—day in and day out. <br><br>

                            If you're looking for someone who can bring order to chaos, 
                            Gio is your guy!
                        </p>

                        <p class="jobTitle"> COO and Co-Founder at FloSports </p>
                        <p>
                            Hardworking is the word that comes to mind when I think of 
                            Giovanni. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing Giovanni for almost 4 
                            years, during which he reported to me. Above all, I was 
                            impressed with Giovanni’s ability to take on a task and make it 
                            happen. And of course, his determination and loyalty. Giovanni 
                            was always positive and willing to take on any project that was 
                            assigned to him and volunteered for projects that were not. <br><br>
                            Giovanni would be a true asset for any positions requiring him to 
                            drive planning and execution of a program as well as finding 
                            solutions to overcome obstacles. Giovanni gets the job done.

                        <h3> Jena Heath </h3>
                        <p class="jobTitle"> Associate Dean, School of Arts & Humanities at St. Edward's University </p>
                        <p>
                                I hired Gio this year as business manager at Hilltop Views, the St. 
                                Edward's University campus newspaper. He has turned the day-
                                to-day working of the paper around by organizing the office, both 
                                physically and in terms of creating systems that help us work 
                                better. Without my urging, he has done everything from clean up 
                                the cluttered newsroom to organize the chaotic archives. Most 
                                importantly, he excels at his most critical task, advertising billing 
                                and collections. Without Gio's low-key demeanor and hyper-
                                organized work skills we would still be catching up when it comes 
                                to our books. He is a gem, easy to work with, take-charge and 
                                efficient. I highly recommend Gio, but please wait to hire him until 
                                he graduates. Hilltop Views needs him!
