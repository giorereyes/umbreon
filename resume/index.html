                        <p class="jobTitle"> Product at FloSports </p>
                        <p>
                            When it comes to everything you want in a co-worker, 
                            Gio ticks all the boxes: organized, humble, sharp, 
                            and a damn good-natured soul!<br>
                            When the Product/Engineering team re-platformed our 
                            entire web app in 2017, I had the luxury of having 
                            him by my side to translate ad-speak into something 
                            a Product Manager who had never touched ad tech could 
                            understand. In a world that is plagued with mountains 
                            of ambiguous information, he kept things tidy and helped 
                            myself and the engineers ship a stellar end-product.<br>
                            And let me tell you, this guy knows DFP like the back of 
                            his hand, has a deep understanding of things that I don't 
                            (VAST, VPAID, IMA), and has the technical chops to dive right 
                            into dev tools with the engineers in order to debug all the 
                            quirky brain teasers that come with running ads in a single-page 
                            application.<br>
                            In fewer words, he crushes it—day in and day out. <br>
                            If you're looking for someone who can bring order to chaos, 
                            Gio is your guy!<br>
